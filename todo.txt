Huge bug : because we use a bool OP on each client, when a client join a new created channel, hes set has op, if he then joins a channel already created, hes still considered OP. Need to replace the bool Op by a vect of <clients *> OpClients to keep track of ops for each channels. | done, need to push harder tests

Check that may be good:
- PASS OK
- NICK OK
- USER OK
- KICK OK
- INVITE OK
