CLEAN Bot code (RPL::Priv) | done
Fix segfault when using /MODE " " | done
Requesting modes shouldn't be only for OPs | done

Look for bugs
ADD CDD file transfer
Use ERR_PASSWDMISMATCH when disconnecting user with wrong pass
Reduce RPL dependecies on package.rpl_data to add clarity to the code
Delete the trailling '\r' in cmdData from parsing (Ft::extractline) and adapt all error checks

Check that may be good:
- PASS OK
- NICK OK
- USER OK
- KICK OK
