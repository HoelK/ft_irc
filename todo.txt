Delete the trailling '\r' in cmdData from parsing (Ft::extractline) and adapt all error checks | done
Huge bug : because we use a bool OP on each client, when a client join a new created channel, hes set has op, if he then joins a channel already created, hes still considered OP. Need to replace the bool Op by a vect of <clients *> OpClients to keep track of ops for each channels. | done, need to push harder tests

Look for bugs
Reduce RPL dependecies on package.rpl_data to add clarity to the code
Subject specify that I/O must be non-blocking but we only use POLLIN for reading, we also need POLLOUT in order to send messages, might be the cause to the lag when spamming messages in a channel

Check that may be good:
- PASS		OK
- NICK		OK
- USER		OK
- KICK		OK
- INVITE	OK
- TOPIC		OK
- PRIV		OK
- MODE
- JOIN
