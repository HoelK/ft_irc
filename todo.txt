CLEAN Bot code (RPL::Priv) | done
Fix segfault when using /MODE " " | done
Requesting modes shouldn't be only for OPs | done
Rename package.cmd_data to package.cmdData (to norm a bit) | done
Use ERR_PASSWDMISMATCH when disconnecting user with wrong pass | done
Fix segfault when client disconnect then CTRL+C on server (probably destructor issue) | done

Look for bugs
Reduce RPL dependecies on package.rpl_data to add clarity to the code
Delete the trailling '\r' in cmdData from parsing (Ft::extractline) and adapt all error checks
Huge bug : because we use a bool OP on each client, when a client join a new created channel, hes set has op, if he then joins a channel already created, hes still considered OP. Need to replace the bool Op by a vect of <clients *> OpClients to keep track of ops for each channels. | done, need to push harder tests

Check that may be good:
- PASS OK
- NICK OK
- USER OK
- KICK OK
- INVITE OK
